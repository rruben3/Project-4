# Project-4
Ruben Robles

Introduction: For this Project we got data from OOI Website [2] that gave us information on hydrophone recordings. Our specific areas of interest were Oregon offshore and shelf cabled sites. With that data we were about to find the spectral levels of the rainy and windy times we found in our previous project two. 

Part 1
A)When there was rain and wind I could see that there were more spikes in the dB level than when it was calm, just rain, or just wind. When there was just rain or just wind they seem to have had similar effects on the sound having frequent spikes in the sound level.

B) According to the charts I plotted, rain seem to have the most effect as there were more and heavier spikes than when it was windy. There was alost more change in noise from the average.

C) I would say the main reasons for obserbing both is the debth of both the sites. The oregon shelf cabled is at a depth of 80m while the offshore is at a depth of 580m

Part 2
1) The bandwith as shown by the spectograms does correlate with what is shown in the Wenz curve. As you can see in the plots correlating to the different noises, the relate to the curves. 

Conclusion:
It was intresting to see the differents in sound levels and also the change depending where the depth was. Also seeing the spectogram of different objects causing noise was awesome to see when thinking of what we learned in class.
